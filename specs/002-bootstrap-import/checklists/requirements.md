# Specification Quality Checklist: Phase 0 Bootstrap - Import & Organize Existing Bookmarks

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 27, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality Review**:
- ✅ Specification is user-focused - all user stories are from Sia's perspective as the first user
- ✅ No implementation details in user stories (no mention of FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Qdrant in user-facing sections)
- ✅ Functional requirements mention specific capabilities (HTML parsing, AI analysis) but focus on WHAT not HOW
- ✅ Written for product stakeholders - scenarios describe the bootstrap journey clearly
- ✅ All mandatory sections completed (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria)

**Requirement Completeness Review**:
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are specified with reasonable defaults
- ✅ All 22 functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-002: "100% import success rate", FR-007: "within 24 hours")
- ✅ Success criteria use measurable metrics (SC-001: 100% import success, SC-004: 85%+ acceptance, SC-011: under $50 cost)
- ✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "Users complete bootstrap workflow in under 4 hours" - no mention of how)
- ✅ All 5 user stories have detailed acceptance scenarios with Given-When-Then format
- ✅ Edge cases cover boundary conditions (duplicates, dead links, large files, AI failures, cost limits)
- ✅ Scope is clearly bounded to Phase 0 (bootstrap only, excludes browser extension from Phase 1)
- ✅ Assumptions section documents 15 constraints including infrastructure prerequisites, cost budget, processing time expectations

**Feature Readiness Review**:
- ✅ FR-001 to FR-022 each map to acceptance scenarios across the 5 user stories
- ✅ User stories cover the complete bootstrap workflow: Import (Story 1) → Process (Story 2) → Cluster (Story 3) → Suggest Projects (Story 4) → Validate (Story 5)
- ✅ Success criteria SC-001 to SC-012 align with user stories and functional requirements
- ✅ No implementation details in success criteria (e.g., "Web interface loads within 2 seconds" not "React components render in <2s")
- ✅ The spec correctly identifies this as prerequisite work before Phase 1 MVP extension development

**Critical Observations**:
- ✅ This spec addresses the cold-start problem - users don't start with zero bookmarks
- ✅ Phase 0 is correctly positioned as foundational work: infrastructure setup + import + AI organization
- ✅ The spec includes validation (Story 5: web interface) to ensure bootstrap worked correctly before building extension
- ✅ Cost budgeting is addressed upfront (SC-011: under $50 for 800 bookmarks, ~$0.06/bookmark)
- ✅ Infrastructure assumption (#8) correctly notes that databases/backend must be operational before import begins

**Overall Assessment**: ✅ PASS - Specification is complete, well-structured, and correctly scoped as Phase 0 prerequisite work. Ready for planning phase.

## Status

✅ **READY FOR NEXT PHASE** - All checklist items pass. This spec should be implemented BEFORE the Phase 1 MVP extension work (spec 001-mvp-foundation). Proceed to `/speckit.plan` for implementation planning.

## Recommended Implementation Order

1. **First**: Implement this spec (002-bootstrap-import) - Set up infrastructure and import/process Sia's 800 bookmarks
2. **Then**: Validate results through web interface and adjust AI-generated organization
3. **Finally**: Proceed to spec 001-mvp-foundation - Build browser extension for ongoing bookmark management
