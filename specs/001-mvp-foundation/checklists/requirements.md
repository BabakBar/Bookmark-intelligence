# Specification Quality Checklist: BookmarkAI MVP Foundation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 27, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality Review**:
- ✅ Specification avoids implementation details (no mention of React, FastAPI, PostgreSQL in user stories)
- ✅ FR-002 and FR-003 mention specific technologies (OpenAI, Claude, Qdrant) but this is acceptable as they define required capabilities and performance targets, not HOW to implement
- ✅ Focus is on WHAT users need (eliminate manual tagging, rediscover forgotten bookmarks, filter by project)
- ✅ Written for product stakeholders - user stories are in plain language

**Requirement Completeness Review**:
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are specified
- ✅ All 20 functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-002 specifies <500ms latency, FR-003 specifies 3-7 tags)
- ✅ Success criteria use measurable metrics (SC-001: <3s latency, SC-003: 85% acceptance rate, SC-006: <5s to find bookmark)
- ✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "Users can save a bookmark and see AI-generated tags within 3 seconds" - no mention of how)
- ✅ All 4 user stories have acceptance scenarios with Given-When-Then format
- ✅ Edge cases cover boundary conditions (empty content, API unavailability, duplicate URLs, 404s)
- ✅ Scope is bounded to Phase 1 MVP features (excludes engagement tracking, chat interface, ephemeral content)
- ✅ Assumptions section clearly documents 15 constraints and dependencies

**Feature Readiness Review**:
- ✅ FR-001 to FR-020 each map to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- ✅ User stories cover all P0 features from Phase 1: auto-tagging (Story 1), context-aware surfacing (Story 2), project mode (Story 3), clustering (Story 4)
- ✅ Success criteria SC-001 to SC-010 align with user stories and functional requirements
- ✅ No implementation details in success criteria (e.g., "System handles users with 1000+ bookmarks" not "PostgreSQL query executes in <100ms")

**Overall Assessment**: ✅ PASS - Specification is complete, well-structured, and ready for planning phase

## Status

✅ **READY FOR NEXT PHASE** - All checklist items pass. Proceed to `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
