## üéØ Key Highlights

### Problem We're Solving
Users save hundreds of bookmarks but:
- Can't find them when needed
- Forget they exist
- Manually organize into folders that become outdated
- Accidentally save duplicates
- Never review 70%+ of saved bookmarks

### Our Solution
- **Context-Aware:** Surface similar bookmarks when saving (prevent duplicates)
- **AI-Powered:** Automatic tagging, summarization, and clustering
- **Project-Based:** Filter bookmarks by active work context
- **Engagement Tracking:** Identify "dead" bookmarks you never use
- **Privacy-First:** On-demand processing, no continuous monitoring

### Cost Efficiency
- **$13/month total** for self-hosted deployment (covers 100-200 users)
- **93% cost savings** vs cloud services ($13 vs $185/month)
- AI costs: $0.04-0.15/month per user depending on model choice
- Complete data ownership with self-hosted infrastructure

### Development Timeline
- **4 weeks:** MVP with core features
- **8 weeks:** Intelligence layer + engagement tracking
- **12 weeks:** Production-ready with advanced features
